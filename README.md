# merchant-registration-application

This is a merchant registration application designed for a food delivery company. It allows merchants to register their businesses and join the food delivery platform. The application consists of a server component and a client component. It is built using the MERN-Stack.

In addition to MERN-Stack, this application features a clean and intuitive user interface, providing a seamless registration experience for merchants looking to join the food delivery platform.

The application also includes authorization features, including a token-based authentication system, to ensure secure access and protect sensitive merchant data. Each merchant is assigned a unique accountUUID, which serves as their authentication token, enabling them to authenticate and authorize themselves when accessing protected routes and performing secure actions within the application.
